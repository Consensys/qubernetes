# This is the core configuration file, at a minimum include:
#   1. the number of nodes entries
#   2. quorum's consensus (istanbul IBFT, or Raft)
#   3. the version of the quorum container and the transaction manager container.
# Reasonable defaults will be chosen for the rest of the values, ports, associated K8s resources, etc.
